# Shirt-fold embodiment adapter

The Hugging Face folding policy and Anvil OpenArm 2.0 are not the same action
embodiment even though both expose 16 values named as seven joints plus a
gripper per arm. The frozen Hugging Face policy uses the modified OpenArm v1
geometry, including a 50 mm longer upper-arm link and custom jaws. Its processor
state is in degrees. The Anvil demonstrations use OpenArm 2.0 kinematics and arm
joints in radians. Copying slots by name therefore preserves neither units nor
TCP motion.

The adapter keeps the folding VLA frozen and composes four explicit stages:

1. Convert an OpenArm 2.0 observation from radians into a reference OpenArm v1
   state by FK, fixed TCP-frame alignment, bounded multi-start IK, and calibrated
   gripper open fraction.
2. Run the original Hugging Face preprocessor, frozen policy, and postprocessor
   without replacing its normalization state.
3. Convert the predicted reference action chunk back to OpenArm 2.0 through the
   inverse kinematic bridge.
4. Apply a small learned, bounded residual in OpenArm 2.0 joint coordinates.

The artifact remains `offline_only`. It is not connected to the live ROS command
path by this change.

## Why joint-angle matching is still useful

Direct v1-to-v2 angle equality is not the primary target because different link
lengths produce different TCP positions. Joint matching is useful after the TCP
constraint as a posture/null-space objective: a 7-DoF arm can reach the same TCP
pose with several shoulder/elbow configurations. The bridge uses the current or
previous solution as that posture seed, and the learned loss includes target-side
joint and velocity terms. It never compares a Hugging Face degree value directly
to an OpenArm 2 radian target.

The deterministic bridge is evaluated before training. On the local shirt-fold
dataset, the default sampled validation accepts 85 of 88 states (96.6%). The
three rejected states miss the overlapping workspace by approximately 1–3 cm
and fail closed rather than being silently clipped into an unrelated motion.

## Loss

For bridge output `q_bridge` and bounded residual network `r_theta`, the command
is

```text
q_hat = q_bridge + b * tanh(r_theta)
```

where `b` is at most 0.15 rad and at most 10% of each target joint range. Gripper
corrections are always zero. Training minimizes

```text
L = L_joint + 0.25 L_pose + 0.05 L_velocity + 0.01 L_residual
```

- `L_joint`: Smooth L1 on OpenArm 2 joint errors normalized by each joint range.
- `L_pose`: differentiable OpenArm 2 FK position error scaled by 5 cm plus TCP
  geodesic orientation error scaled by 0.25 rad.
- `L_velocity`: Smooth L1 on consecutive target-side joint deltas.
- `L_residual`: squared residual as a fraction of its safety bound.

The pose term handles link-length geometry. The joint and velocity terms select
the demonstrator's shoulder/elbow posture among redundant IK solutions and keep
chunks temporally coherent.

## Pinned inputs

The manifest is
`configs/embodiment_adapters/hf_folding_to_anvil_openarm2.json`. It pins:

- `lerobot-data-collection/folding_final` at revision
  `695abe40dbf3aac04efda59c1501d748681fa0fb`;
- both processor JSON files and both normalization-state files by SHA-256;
- the 16-D right-then-left vector contract and degree/radian units;
- the mesh-free modified-v1 and Anvil-v2 kinematic models by SHA-256;
- TCP-frame alignment, IK tolerances/restarts, gripper endpoints, and residual
  bounds.

The normalization-state hash matters: the policy's observed arm features are in
degrees, and swapping in a processor trained on OpenArm 2 radians recreates the
same scale failure the adapter is intended to prevent.

## Offline workflow

Validate the manifest and sampled OpenArm 2 IK coverage without model weights:

```bash
uv run anvil-adapter validate \
  --manifest configs/embodiment_adapters/hf_folding_to_anvil_openarm2.json \
  --dataset datasets/shirt-fold/lerobot \
  --stride 500
```

Obtain the exact frozen policy once. This is a large download:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/lerobot-data-collection/folding_final \
  model_zoo/hf-folding-final
```

Then validate all processor content hashes:

```bash
uv run anvil-adapter validate \
  --manifest configs/embodiment_adapters/hf_folding_to_anvil_openarm2.json \
  --base-policy model_zoo/hf-folding-final \
  --dataset datasets/shirt-fold/lerobot
```

Cache the frozen policy every ten frames. The optional baseline is the existing
5k OpenArm 2 fine-tune and is run directly, without the embodiment bridge:

```bash
uv run anvil-adapter cache \
  --manifest configs/embodiment_adapters/hf_folding_to_anvil_openarm2.json \
  --base-policy model_zoo/hf-folding-final \
  --baseline-policy model_zoo/openarm2-real-topshort-teleop-v1/pi05_openarm2_flat_shirt_expert_v1/checkpoints/005000/pretrained_model \
  --dataset datasets/shirt-fold/lerobot \
  --split-info model_zoo/openarm2-real-topshort-teleop-v1/pi05_openarm2_flat_shirt_expert_v1/checkpoints/005000/pretrained_model/split_info.json \
  --output adapter_cache/shirt-fold-frozen-hf.npz \
  --task "Fold the T-shirt properly" \
  --stride 10 \
  --device cuda
```

Cache generation uses the checkpoint's exact episode split and deterministic
noise seeds. Rejected IK samples are listed next to the cache in a JSON report.
The bridge column is produced with a zero-initialized residual, so it is the
required bridge-only sanity baseline.

Train only the residual:

```bash
uv run anvil-adapter train \
  --manifest configs/embodiment_adapters/hf_folding_to_anvil_openarm2.json \
  --cache adapter_cache/shirt-fold-frozen-hf.npz \
  --output model_zoo/adapters/hf-folding-to-openarm2-v1 \
  --steps 5000 \
  --device cuda
```

Compare hold, deterministic bridge, learned adapter, and the optional current
5k baseline on train/validation/test episodes:

```bash
uv run anvil-adapter evaluate \
  --adapter model_zoo/adapters/hf-folding-to-openarm2-v1 \
  --cache adapter_cache/shirt-fold-frozen-hf.npz \
  --output eval_results/shirt-fold/embodiment-adapter.json \
  --device cuda
```

Reported metrics include range-normalized joint MAE, shoulder J1/J2 MAE, TCP
position/orientation error, commanded motion, and motion ratio. A residual
training run is justified only if the bridge-only result is kinematically sane
and the learned adapter improves validation/test metrics rather than only the
training split.

## Live gate

Do not change `deployment_status` to `live_approved` based only on offline loss.
Promotion requires the devbox connected to the arms, low-speed shadow output,
per-joint direction checks, reachable-pose checks, command-rate measurement,
and a hardware e-stop test. Live artifact loading refuses an `offline_only`
manifest.
